# GCloud_ML_API_experiment
Experimenting with various Google cloud (GCloud) Machine Learning APIs -
I have taken reference from following - 
  1. Sentdex video series on Google cloud APIs - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chk2rRjSn5o (initial video)
      However, the code mentioned there is Old. So, updated the code as per latest documentation from google.
  2. Google cloud Documentations

Steps to follow - 

1. Launching VM on GCloud -
   The process is explained in detail by sentdex using videos - 
   Setting up VM - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chk2rRjSn5o
   Setting up API - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMY0qDg16y4
   So, no updation required here.

2. Vision API - 
    Vision API can be used to detect Object, Face, OCR (Optical Character Recognition), etc. (https://cloud.google.com/vision/)
    Project Setup - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBk0zBOAUM&t=350s
    Updated code is present in  -- VisionEx.py
    
3. Natural Language API -
    It can be used to perform sentiment analysis, entity analysis etc. -- (https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/)
    Project Setup - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-13yIXiyFAs
    Updated code is present in  ---- NatlangEx.py
